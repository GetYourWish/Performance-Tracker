/**
 * Local Expo config plugin: strip every permission the RELEASE app does not
 * use.
 *
 * Why (user-reported 2026-09-17): "why does the app have network access
 * permissions? we did not build an app that requires the internet at all —
 * the tracker.json file is synced between devices by OTHER software
 * (Syncthing); the app itself only reads and writes it locally."
 *
 * He is right. The Expo bare template's main AndroidManifest.xml ships a
 * generic permission set:
 *
 *   INTERNET                — no network code exists in this app; the bundle
 *                             is embedded; nothing is ever fetched
 *   SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW     — RN dev-overlay tooling; nothing draws overlays
 *   VIBRATE                 — nothing vibrates
 *   READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE   — SAF needs NO storage permissions at all
 *   WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE  — (same; on Android <= 12 these two would even
 *                             show up as "storage" permission grants)
 *
 * All five are pure template baggage for this app.
 *
 * How: a RELEASE-variant manifest overlay at
 *   android/app/src/release/AndroidManifest.xml
 * with `tools:node="remove"` on each permission. The Android manifest merger
 * applies variant source sets only to that variant, so:
 *   - RELEASE: merged manifest has none of the five permissions
 *   - DEBUG:   untouched (main manifest keeps INTERNET etc. — Metro/dev
 *              server tooling may need it; dev builds are never shipped)
 *
 * Deliberately NOT removed: the
 *   <app-package>.DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION
 * entry that shows up in permission inspector apps. That one is INJECTED by
 * androidx-core when a library registers a runtime broadcast receiver with
 * RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED (required on API 33+; RN/expo do this at startup).
 * It is a self-defined, signature-level marker that grants this app nothing
 * and other apps nothing — removing it can crash receiver registration. It
 * is not a permission the app "requests"; there is no way to opt out.
 *
 * Idempotent: the overlay is fully rewritten on every prebuild (prebuild
 * --clean regenerates android/ from the template anyway).
